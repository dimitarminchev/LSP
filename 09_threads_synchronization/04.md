## Why is synchronization needed?

**Thread synchronization** is the concurrent execution of two or more threads that share critical resources. 

Threads should be synchronized to avoid critical resource use conflicts.

Otherwise, conflicts may arise when parallel-running threads attempt to modify a common variable at the same time.
